                                <ul>
                                    <li>Owners of even the best-trained pets will occasionally encounter pet accidents. Often, the urine is not discovered until long after the accident.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Pet odors like cat urine, dog urine, and other types of pet urine are difficult to remove.—if pet odor remains, pets will keep on coming to the same spot every time. Pets who are prone to “accidents” can give your home an unpleasant aroma.</li>
<br>
                                    <li>Magic One Services can help you fight pet odor so that your carpets and upholstery get a new look with a fragrance of freshness. Our cleaning professionals use the most advanced pet odor removers that eliminate pet odor without harming your carpets and furnishings.</li>
<br>
                                    <li>Magic One Services uses different products, some of which contain enzymes that will actually break down the source of the odor.</li>
<br>
                                    <li>Odors should be eliminated when they first happen, because the longer the source of an odor stays on a surface, the harder it will be to get rid of. Waiting too long requires professional cleaning services to eliminate these unpleasant odors.</li>
<br>
                                    <li>Please take the time to call our office during our regular business hours or fill out our online information request form to get a quote so you can make an informed decision.</li>
